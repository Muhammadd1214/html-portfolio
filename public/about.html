<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings from the serene small town of Usterzai Payan in Kohat, KPK! 

  I am a student of Business Administration with a deep, unwavering passion for marketing.
   As a responsible citizen, I aspire to market businesses that balance their revenue-generating
    operations with endeavors that advance sociiecty.
   I'm a strong advocate of marketing that draws customers desiring
    to change the world with their purchases.
     Learning marketing strategies that aim to benefit the community through useful services and goods is a dream for me</p>

<p>Participating in the annual business fest at my university this year made me realize that marketing 
  is my true calling. I find unravelling the mysteries of consumer behavior fascinating 
  and am intrigued by techniques used for weaving compelling, persuasive messages. 
  UGrad isn't just an ordinary opportunity to go abroad;
   it's a golden chance to dive deeper into the world of marketing and grasp concepts 
   that I can apply back home in Pakistan. I can't wait to learn at one of the best institutions
    in the US and gain insights that will shape my career in a myriad of ways.</p>
